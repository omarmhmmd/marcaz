As the most widely used digital platform of our time, it was almost inevitable that the dots would eventually connect even in a highly dispersed diaspora. Seeing the portrait again on my phone screen led me to artist and curator Muheb Esmat. In conversation, we put together different pieces of a puzzle we did not know we were solving. Published in 2013, Enayatullah Shahrani had cataloged Noori’s portrait of his wife in Contemporary Painters of Afghanistan.
