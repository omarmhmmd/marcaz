Housed in a restored former Royal residence built in the image of 19th-century Europe, a style of architecture favored by the monarchy in the late 19th and early 20th century, the National Gallery opened its doors in May of 1983. Under the Ministry of Information and Culture's auspices, the museum was set up to preserve and exhibit local and international artists' works. Its initial collection of 200 works assembled from the Royal Palace and other museums grew to more than 800 objects by local and foreign artists through a yearly acquisitions program. Unfortunately, this evident growth saw a disturbing end when works from the gallery were looted and destroyed during the Afghan civil war in the early 90’s and the subsequent Taliban regime. The gallery’s recent tumultuous history is tied to the broader calamity suffered by the arts and culture in the country from the ongoing war; which has simultaneously borne incredible stories of resistance to the destructive forces as famously highlighted by "},{"_key":"471d7800917e","_type":"span","marks":["4b7b762dba92"],"text":"the gallery staff painting over figurative works"},{"_key":"cf45797cd5bb","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" outlawed by the Taliban to save them from destruction."}],"markDefs":[{"_key":"4b7b762dba92","_type":"link","href":"https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/art/meet-dr-mohammad-yousef-asefi-the-man-who-saved-afghan-art-from-the-taliban-1.840534"}],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"91e3cc051ad4","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"5b734c26a7fc","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"High on the wall in the middle of a dimly lit hallway hangs an "},{"_key":"cacf4cecd792","_type":"span","marks":["em"],"text":"untitled"},{"_key":"26a0bb273849","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":" painting by Sayed Maqdos Negah (1937-2000) — a work that had rested as the screen saver for my phone for years prior, yet even more radiant and magnetic in person.

As the only institution tasked with collecting and preserving modern and contemporary arts in Afghanistan, ANG's collection is overwhelmingly focused on painting, realism, and male artists working in Kabul before the ’90s. Which means that there are not only evident gaps in its collection of 20th-century art from Afghanistan, the institution has also fallen short of keeping pace with the incredible work produced by contemporary Afghan artists. In a way, the fragmented ecosystems that Afghan artists work across is partly due to the institution’s failure in supporting and steering the local art ecosystem and conversation around art and culture in and about the country. With that said, I do believe there are works and histories in the collection that with further research and attention could serve as a stepping stone towards filling a strongly felt gap in the lack of a concise history of 20th-century art in Afghanistan.
