After a quick pat-down and an inspection of my backpack, a security guard, lounging on his chair sipping on a glass of green tea, points me towards the entrance at the back. Passing office doors open to both sides, in the middle of a dimly lit hallway, hangs an untitled painting by Sayed Muqaddos Negah (1937-2000) — a work that had rested as the screen saver for my phone for years prior, yet even more radiant and magnetic in person. High on the wall, with a layer of rubbery black paint setting the background, the image depicts three musicians march to the right as they respectively play their Rubab, Tambura, and Surnai. The sharp contours of Negah's figures, bordering between Cubism and outright use of geometric shapes, and the imagined melodies of their instruments tear through the damning silence in the gallery. In the vein of artists searching for creativity and change through different mediums, Negah was not only a painter, but also a writer, journalist, and a prominent figure in Kabul's burgeoning theater scene during the ’60s and ’70s. His paintings and marble collages with symmetrically balanced compositions present an exploration of the boundaries of geometric shapes as dynamic expressions able to convey experiences of the physical world through subtle abstraction of visual metaphors."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"da39f0236e34","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"The National Gallery of Afghanistan","asset":{"_ref":"image-2d1ede4ce7aa991041c47537fe9292d1cafcb7df-651x488-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"The National Gallery of Afghanistan in Kabul, Image by Michal Hvrockey"},{"_key":"e7212c97c9b3","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e6678a83bf190","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Housed in a restored former Royal residence built in the image of 19th-century Europe, a style of architecture favored by the monarchy in the late 19th and early 20th century, the National Gallery opened its doors in 1983. Under the Ministry of Information and Culture's auspices, the museum was set up to preserve and exhibit local and international artists' works. Its initial collection of 200 works assembled from the Royal Palace and other museums grew to more than 800 objects by local and foreign artists through a yearly acquisitions program. Unfortunately, this evident growth saw a disturbing end when works from the gallery were looted and destroyed during the Afghan civil war in the early 90’s and the subsequent Taliban regime. The gallery’s recent history is evident of the broader calamity suffered by the arts and culture in the country from the ongoing war; which has also borne incredible stories of resistance to the destructive forces as famously highlighted by the gallery staff painting over figurative works outlawed by the Taliban to save them from destruction."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"61df69d66b3c","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"d8058ed555f3","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"281018090dd6","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Sayed Muqaddos Negah Painting","asset":{"_ref":"image-1680441f2cff5ca03ddf632f6e615c2addc044d2-3024x3024-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Sayed Muqaddos Negah, Untitled, date unknown, oil on canvas."},{"_key":"037aa1fefd7d","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"29e6143a50b60","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Across from Negah's work hangs an impressionist spring landscape identified only as a work of an 'unknown artist.’ By utilizing a salon hang, the narrow hallway holds more work than one could imagine. A stack of prints on paper is left upon a table at the far end of the hallway for visitors to sort through — the kind of informality that feels both groundbreaking in being able to touch the works and concerning when one thinks about these works' long-term preservation Halfway through the hallway, a red carpet hugs the stairs and invites the viewer to the second floor. Several paintings by Master Abdul Aziz sit high on the walls adjacent to the stairs. In an oil on canvas painting, a roaring tiger crawls out of the woods and looks directly at the viewer. Aziz, originally from India, was both a court painter and an art teacher in Kabul in the early 20th century. The artist’s presence and influence in Kabul is part of a broader history of artists, architects, musicians, and intellectuals from British India visiting and working in Kabul at the time."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"ce6a4a3406b1","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"06b7fd0d4ace","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"85eaddf3cb85","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Master Abdul Aziz","asset":{"_ref":"image-9f17c97c0a4eb295c5a3532ef8990fddd003dacc-3024x4032-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Master Abdul Aziz, Tiger, oil on canvas.

An earthly pallet painting of the ancient Bala Hissar fortress that now lies in its own dust, representative of the country's historical architecture and its tragic fate, sits beneath a colorfully energetic and moving portrayal of an Atan (traditional Pashtun dance) scene by Abdul Wodood Shpoon. In Shpoon's work, the men dawned in colorful garbs, and their jet-black hair frozen amid a twirl are flanked by two Dhull players. In the same category as the 'unknown artist' attributions, several works hanging on the right side of the hallway are merely identified as works by \"foreigner\" artists. A strikingly realistic painting of a sea, where fierce waves are energetically dancing towards the shore beneath a soft blue-sky creeping beyond the milky clouds, is hard to miss. Intrigued by the work and the artist's apparent signature, with a quick Google search, I was able to find the work to be by a German maritime painter named Patrick Von Kalckreuth (1892-1970). How did Von Kalckreuth's painting end up in Kabul?"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"5b9904c26c96","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"17b0892a08610","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Tucked at the right corner beyond a short entrance door are two galleries dedicated to the works of a monumental figure considered by many to be the father of new Afghan painting, Ghulam Mohammad Maimanagi (1873-1935). One of the two distinguished panels installed side by side is recognized as a portrayal of a scene from Europe. This relatively large oil painting depicts a water canal surrounded by lush greenery on the left and an elevated sidewalk on the right, effectively directing the viewer's attention to the buildings at the back (need to be better defined). Aside from Amir Habibullah Khan's portrait, most of Maimanagi's works in the gallery portray nature and, more specifically, European landscapes. A youthful prodigy, the artist, received his early training in painting from the local artists Mohammad Azim Abkam and Mir Hussamudin and the British physician, John Alfred Gray. In 1921, with support from the local government, Maimanagi traveled to Germany to further his art education. The artist’s visit to Germany put into perspective what could have inspired his fascination with the landscapes of Europe, as evidenced by the fact that most of the works available in the gallery likely date back to the last two decades of his life. Upon returning home, Maimanagi helped establish the country's first art academy (مکتب صنایع نفیسه), which would go on to serve as a major catalyst in training the next generation of artists in Kabul. While it is impossible to summarize Maimanagi's elusive career in a single paragraph, what I believe is one of his most significant legacies that has deeply penetrated the local painting DNA to this day is a deep belief in realism with a touch of romanticism casting its gaze towards nature."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"da88bf79ccbb","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Ghulan Maimanagi Painting","asset":{"_ref":"image-96c7a2053432b7865c70e93300a1e60c7db4a332-4032x3024-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Paintings by Ghulam Mohammad Maimanagi on view at the National Galley.

Thick daubs of oil paint in relatively dark hues give form to a disappearing representation of a wedding scene as remnants of a bride in a white dress and a groom in a black tux march side by side towards the canvas's right corner. This superb painting by Ghaussodin Khan (1910-1995) from 1960 offers an adulterated representation of what paint can achieve with the slight but masterful guidance of a hand like the Khan's. Stepping past the short door between the rooms turned into galleries, with the afternoon sun staring directly onto the floor, watercolor paintings of Kaman-e-bust (or Taq-i bust) in Helmand province, and the Noh Gunbad Mosque located in the northern province of Balkh hang on the wall across from the window. In these diligently painted varicolored images, Yosuf Kohzad (1931-2019) gives the viewer a glimpse into the country's cultural heritage and its deteriorated and forgotten state. Kohzad, a writer and poet, recently passed away in California, far away from a place he so generously and truthfully depicts as his watercolor paintings exhibited in the gallery attest."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"284f669d424d","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"816e4397a22b","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"ebb86972b0cf","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"419088f7cec40","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Upon entering the final gallery on the second floor, a vertically oriented portrait by Hafizullah Khan Wafa (1985-2006) titled A teacher in Nejat High School(1948) stared back at me with an inscrutable gaze. It depicts a male figure dressed in a pale white shirt, blue tie, and a dark brown jacket that fades into the background. His haircut of undercut sides and a textured length on top is almost a match for Cillian Murphy's character Thomas Shelby in the award-winning BBC Drama Series Peaky Blinders. On the adjacent wall, hanging high up, a young man stares down at the viewer, almost with a slight chuckle. A glimpse of his long hair becomes visible from underneath the fine white turban that sets above his eyes with its tail loosely snaking around his chin with the end tucked in the fold of the turban on the opposite shoulder. The white turban not only frames the subject's face but also elevates through its contrast a peanut brown coat hugging the red scarf dripping down his shoulders, with a brief glimpse of a dark green jacket creeping down the middle of his chest. This oil on canvas painting titled Afghan Man (1970) is by Khair Muhammad Yari (1912-1979). In contrast to Wafa's close focus on his subject's face, Yari’s portraits provide the viewer with an extended image of his subject. Together, these diligently painted dramatic and striking portraits by Wafa and Yari are reminders of the less explored history of portraiture painting in the Afghan context."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"c9c96b74c12f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"d6ad7f9a671f0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Stunned by this experience of witnessing this almost anonymous treasure of art and history, as I walked down the stairs on my way out, my eyes caught glimpses of a painting I had missed earlier. Hanging high above a door across from the stairs was a portrait of a male figure dressed in classical European fashion with his right hand resting upon a book placed at the front of the left corner, with a recreation of Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People (1830) situated behind him. With no information available in the gallery and after exhausting the usual research venues, I recently turned to Reddit to crowdsource possible clues. To my surprise, one Reddit user offered a potential lead into the figure's identity that I think is quite plausible. Based on the figure posing with a book, it is likely that they are an author, and knowing that the boy holding a gun up in Delacroix's painting is believed to have been an inspiration of the Gavroche character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Misérables, this could be a portrait of Victor Hugo himself. Whether this theory turns out to be true is hard to predict, but what is true is that there are histories to be told about each work in this collection."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"557dea318ddc","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Hugo","asset":{"_ref":"image-fb16ce65adbdc0713478356e10df90d58fdbed1a-3024x3024-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"A portrait of Victor Hugo by an unknown artist.

While the institution and its staffs’ efforts in safeguarding the collection through some of the most devastating moments of Afghan history in recent decades is commendable, the works in the museum are in dire need of further preservation as there is extensive evidence of damages, both from light and puncture or decay, across many works currently exhibited.

Afghan artists inside the country and in diaspora work in fragmented ecosystems partly due to institutions such as the National Gallery forgoing their duty in supporting and steering the art ecosystem. The National Gallery’s invisibility in both local and broader conversations of art and culture in the region bares a wider effect on the exclusion of Afghan artists and their histories from any meaningful conversations. As evidenced above, there are works and histories in the collection that with further research and attention could serve as a stepping stone towards filling a strongly felt gap in the lack of a concise history of modern and contemporary art from Afghanistan. With that said, the inclusivity of such history will hinge on urgently addressing the evident gaps in the collection through acquisition and exhibitions. Which in turn could provide contemporary Afghan artists working locally and abroad with a platform to grow and become visible through, allowing the National Gallery to effectively serve the current and next generation of artists to come."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"d777f8c0d22f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"7227f5941cc10","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"\n"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"maimanagi-negah-and-hugo-the-national-gallery-in-kabul"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
