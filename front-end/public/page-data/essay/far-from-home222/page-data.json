In his brief absence, I glanced around his modest apartment. From the Afghan rug on the floor to the stacks of books, photographs sitting next to the TV set, and his works hanging on the walls, my eyes could not rest still in the maximalism of the decor, reminiscent of many living rooms back home.

Working a random job to make ends meet, he accidentally ran into a sculpture exhibition at the Lincoln Center. On his walk home, tears began to flow down his face, thinking not only about his fate but also the state of the arts in his home country. Arguably, one of the leading modern sculptors in Kabul now roamed New York's streets as an unknown figure in exile. The thought of such an abrupt identity loss and sacrifice is achingly painful, yet is the stark reality of many Afghan artists of his generation who left the country searching for survival at the cost of everything they had ever built and dreamt of doing."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"320bdf0e8d2a","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8355709799650","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"I offered to help prepare the table for lunch, but in typical Afghan hospitality, Haiderzad insisted that I do not move and gave me a catalog to look through. He had prepared one of the dishes that I most missed from Home, the famous Qabili Palau (rice cooked with raisins and carrots) with sides of Kofta (meatballs) and Banjan (eggplant). As we sat, I asked him about his museum in Kabul and what it took to make that project happen. In the next hour or so, I was given a brief window into the fascinating story that makes Haiderzad. Born in 1939, Haiderzad graduated from Habibya High School in Kabul. He then received a prestigious government scholarship in 1960 to study fine arts in Rome. It was here that he learned to work with both marble and metal, creating powerful forms that thread beautifully between abstract and realistic figures —forming a new sculptural language that merged the historical and modern sensibilities of Afghan society."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"9678f0610b44","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Haiderzad working on his marble sculpture in Italy.

When the communist regime came into power through a military coup in 1978, it instigated a campaign to imprison and even kill dissident academics. Through whispers, Haiderzad found out that he was part of a group of intellectuals that the regime was targeting. Fearing for his life, the artist fled the country for Pakistan before migrating to the United States. To cope with the unfathomable pains of exile and the unfamiliar city and culture that he now calls Home, Haiderzad continued to make works and even ventured into new styles. He made a series of abstract calligraphic sculptures that the Queens Museum and the Silvermine Art Center would later exhibit."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"170c4c7cd07c","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"A concrete sculpture inspired by the Buddhist frescoes in Bamiyan, 1967.

Funded with the help of an Afghan entrepreneur living in New Jersey, Haiderzad had sent his entire body of work, comprising sculpture, painting, and medals, to Kabul with the promise of being given a space to establish a museum dedicated to his life long career. What unfolded, however, was much the contrary. From the customs authorities who recklessly abandoned his work for numerous days under the sun to his former students objecting to the idea of creating a gallery space in the confines of the fine arts department, to eventually being offered multiple rooms in an old palace shared with the Ethnography Museum --Haiderzad's oeuvre struggled to find a welcoming home. His tiring journey in giving back to his country and sharing his career's worth of works with his fellow Afghans had been equally frustrating as it was rewarding."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"80755cf48fbe","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Installation view of Haiderzad's works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019","asset":{"_ref":"image-947804655d2d6174cef6add134b08bba42e7d82b-2272x1704-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Installation view of Haiderzad's works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019"},{"_key":"94b19dd6e708","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"905076643ccb","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"I quickly glanced at my phone -- it was 2:30 pm.
