Its initial collection of 200 works assembled from the Royal Palace and other museums grew to more than 800 objects by local and foreign artists through a yearly acquisitions program.

Which means that there are not only evident gaps in its collection of 20th-century art from Afghanistan, the institution has also fallen short of keeping pace with the incredible work produced by contemporary Afghan artists. In a way, the fragmented ecosystems that Afghan artists work across is partly due to the institution’s failure in supporting and steering the local art ecosystem and conversation around art and culture in and about the country. With that said, I do believe there are works and histories in the collection that with further research and attention could serve as a stepping stone towards filling a strongly felt gap in the lack of a concise history of 20th-century art in Afghanistan.

Fearing for his life, the artist fled the country for Pakistan before migrating to the United States. To cope with the unfathomable pains of exile and the unfamiliar city and culture that he now calls Home, Haiderzad continued to make works and even ventured into new styles. He made a series of abstract calligraphic sculptures that the Queens Museum and the Silvermine Art Center would later exhibit."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"170c4c7cd07c","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"A concrete sculpture inspired by the Buddhist frescoes in Bamiyan, 1967.

Funded with the help of an Afghan entrepreneur living in New Jersey, Haiderzad had sent his entire body of work, comprising sculpture, painting, and medals, to Kabul with the promise of being given a space to establish a museum dedicated to his life long career. What unfolded, however, was much the contrary. From the customs authorities who recklessly abandoned his work for numerous days under the sun to his former students objecting to the idea of creating a gallery space in the confines of the fine arts department, to eventually being offered multiple rooms in an old palace shared with the Ethnography Museum --Haiderzad's oeuvre struggled to find a welcoming home. His tiring journey in giving back to his country and sharing his career's worth of works with his fellow Afghans had been equally frustrating as it was rewarding."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"80755cf48fbe","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Installation view of Haiderzad's works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019","asset":{"_ref":"image-947804655d2d6174cef6add134b08bba42e7d82b-2272x1704-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Installation view of Haiderzad's works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019"},{"_key":"94b19dd6e708","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"905076643ccb","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"I quickly glanced at my phone -- it was 2:30 pm. Though I knew my train was departing in half an hour, it was still hard to utter the words I had to leave. I could have sat there and listened to Haiderzad for days, but I knew that there would be more chances to come. After multiple selfies on his iPad, we said our goodbyes, and I rushed to the elevator. I left with not only a glimpse into Haiderzad's life in his modest Manhattan apartment but also a deeper appreciation for an artist who has spent close to six decades making art in the face of the most tumultuous circumstances that life has thrown at him."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"1c104f4c0b8b","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Installation view of Haiderzads works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019","asset":{"_ref":"image-70c145f80c73f385f8f7f8e18ab553768c9d6af2-2272x1704-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Installation view of Haiderzads works at Haiderzad Museum of Modern Art in Kabul. 2019"}]}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
