Passing office doors open to both sides, in the middle of a dimly lit hallway, hangs an untitled painting by Sayed Muqaddos Negah (1937-2000) — a work whose digital image had rested as the screen saver for my phone for years prior, yet even more radiant and magnetic in person. High on the wall, with a layer of rubbery black paint setting the background, the image depicts three musicians march to the right as they respectively play their Rubab, Tambura, and Surnai. The sharp contours of Negah's figures, bordering between Cubism and outright use of geometric shapes, and the imagined melodies of their instruments tear through the damning silence in the gallery. In the vein of artists searching for creativity and change through different mediums, Negah was not only a painter, but also a writer, journalist, and a prominent figure in Kabul's burgeoning theater scene during the ’60s and ’70s. His paintings and marble collages with symmetrically balanced compositions present an exploration of the boundaries of geometric shapes as dynamic expressions able to convey experiences of the physical world through the subtle abstraction of visual metaphors."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"da39f0236e34","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"The National Gallery of Afghanistan","asset":{"_ref":"image-2d1ede4ce7aa991041c47537fe9292d1cafcb7df-651x488-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"The National Gallery of Afghanistan in Kabul, Image by Michal Hvrockey"},{"_key":"e7212c97c9b3","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e6678a83bf190","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Housed in a restored former Royal residence built in the image of 19th-century Europe, a style of architecture favored by the monarchy in the late 19th and early 20th century, the National Gallery opened its doors in 1983.

This relatively large oil painting depicts a water canal surrounded by lush greenery on the left and an elevated sidewalk on the right, effectively directing the viewer's attention to the buildings at the back (. Aside from Amir Habibah Khan's portrait, most of Maimanagi's works in the gallery portray nature and, more specifically, European landscapes. A youthful prodigy, the artist, received his early training in painting from the local artists Mohammad Azim Abkam and Mir Hussamudin and the British physician, John Alfred Gray. In 1921, with support from the local government, Maimanagi traveled to Germany to further his art education. The artist’s visit to Germany put into perspective what could have inspired his fascination with the landscapes of Europe, as evidenced by the fact that most of the works available in the gallery likely date back to the last two decades of his life. Upon returning home, Maimanagi helped establish the country's first art academy (مکتب صنایع نفیسه), which would go on to serve as a major catalyst in training the next generation of artists in Kabul. While it is impossible to summarize Maimanagi's elusive career in a single paragraph, what I believe is one of his most significant legacies that has deeply penetrated the local painting DNA to this day is a deep belief in realism with a touch of romanticism casting its gaze towards nature."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"da88bf79ccbb","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Ghulan Maimanagi Painting","asset":{"_ref":"image-96c7a2053432b7865c70e93300a1e60c7db4a332-4032x3024-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Paintings by Ghulam Mohammad Maimanagi on view at the National Galley.

The white turban not only frames the subject's face but also elevates through its contrast a peanut brown coat hugging the red scarf dripping down his shoulders, with a brief glimpse of a dark green jacket creeping down the middle of his chest.

To my surprise, one Reddit user offered a potential lead into the figure's identity that I think is quite plausible. Based on the figure posing with a book, it is likely that they are an author, and knowing that the boy holding a gun up in Delacroix's painting is believed to have been an inspiration of the Gavroche character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Misérables, this could be a portrait of Victor Hugo himself.

Born in 1939, Haiderzad graduated from Habibya High School in Kabul. He then received a prestigious government scholarship in 1960 to study fine arts in Rome.

Through whispers, Haiderzad found out that he was part of a group of intellectuals that the regime was targeting. Fearing for his life, the artist fled the country for Pakistan before migrating to the United States. To cope with the unfathomable pains of exile and the unfamiliar city and culture that he now calls Home, Haiderzad continued to make works and even ventured into new styles.
