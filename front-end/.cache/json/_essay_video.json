The closed windows hovering above their heads are ambiguous in their representation of inside and outside, resulting in a powerful gesture pointing towards the inescapable realities that women face across both spaces.

Helped by her elongated neck of humiliated flesh, the figure hopelessly rests her head on her right shoulder. Avoiding prevalent cliches around women’s representation in art from and about Afghanistan, Rafi’s distinct interest in the ambiguity of her subjects allows her work to dislodge the viewer from the comfort of their place in the world and recognize and contemplate the neck-breaking weight of being a woman in today’s Afghanistan."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"734d1b30eb32","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"0df64f1ac5e7","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"bf136af37b2f","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"Jahan Ara Rafi","asset":{"_ref":"image-fc0ac05d6597991cfec57cfde8590b527a44c4e0-2790x3370-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Pictured: Jahan Ara Rafi, Untitled, 2019.

As the country continues to struggle with a brutal war and the clouds of uncertainty around its future continue to expand, artists such as Hassani, Horakhsh, and Rafi face genuine concerns around their place as Afghan women artists. As the works in the exhibition testified, the realities of being a woman and an artist in Kabul have never been easy. And if the years since the show could attest to anything, it has not gotten any better since. Evident by the male-dominated peace negotiations between the current Afghan government and the Taliban, which has so far been a disastrous ordeal, to say the least, life as an artist and a woman will not get any easier in the future. Unless we take a deeper and critical look at the roots of the inherent inequalities prevalent across all lines of life and ponder together what role women and artists want to have in constructing an inclusive societal “frame” for the future."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"48f7827167e2","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"b0cac2c69f9e0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}]}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"video"}}
