As the most widely used digital platform of our time, it was almost inevitable that dots across different locations would connect even in the most dispersed of diasporas. Seeing the portrait again on my phone screen, triggered a conversation with artist and curator Muheb Esmat, who is based in New York, and quickly helped put different pieces of a puzzle we did not know we were solving, together. Published in 2013, Enayatullah Shahrani had cataloged Noori’s portrait of his wife in Contemporary Painters of Afghanistan.

The monarchy enabled financial aid from initially Germany, Italy, and in competing fashion, the US and Soviet Union, which on the ground took the form of scholarship opportunities, inviting young Afghans to programs abroad. Among them was Noori — who by this point of receiving an award to pursue a Master’s degree at the Surikov Art Institute in Moscow, had graduated from the newly established Faculty of Arts at Kabul University, an initiative led by sculptor Amanullah Haiderzad who studied in Italy.

At that time, he had just returned to Kabul from studying in Germany. So this exchange triggered that very first idea, that first confidence to pursue something greater that this practice contained, and his feedback always stayed with me.” Thus, it only made sense to take the kankor exam in 1975 and pursue a Bachelor’s degree at this brand new faculty, where he studied under Enayatullah Shahrani, a University of Arizona alumni, as well as Khawani Khan, who trained in Germany. It was here that Noori’s life-long friendship began with both professors and later peers. “We strictly followed realism and classicism under Khan’s mentorship, which made sense, considering his education in mid-century Europe.” Soon after graduating from Kabul University, Noori won a faculty teaching position. This, however, was a short-lived dream of a young artist and academic. With growing political unrest in the state, Afghanistan deposed its last monarch in 1973 and went through an era of a republic under Daoud Khan, before the coup of 1978, which plunged the nation into the ongoing conflict and occupation today. Like many, Noori was conscripted to serve under a highly factionisalist communist party in 1983. “Naturally, the PDPA evaluated the function I could fill and quickly came to realize that an artist was better equipped to serve the flag with a pen, rather than arms. And so, I became the illustrator for the widely circulating Zhvandūn Magazine and joined the Writer’s Union."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"774f871433fa","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e4a5fbea2e4c0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"7678b6d79455","_type":"imgCaption","alt":"magazine","asset":{"_ref":"image-1c544205dac7d77dba900e99399f13c593634be8-703x958-jpg","_type":"reference"},"caption":"Zhvandūn (ژوندون), vol. 3, no. 6, 1984. pg. 1, 89.

Naturally, I had to abandon my studies and decided to stay in Moscow until the unrest settled down.” However, this moment never came. What followed in subsequent years was the fate of millions of Afghans — displaced, dispossessed, deported — an ongoing occurrence to this very day. Re-entering the Russian labor market, Noori took up work in retail wholesale until ultimately migrating to Germany in 1999 with his wife and now four children. “It took me years to build from ground zero again. On top of that, the wait for a residence permit was incredibly dreadful in the background of our efforts. There was no opportunity, no time, let alone headspace for a creative practice to take up room.
